My Hip Replacement Recovery Diary
A Personal Journey Towards Healing and Strength
Welcome to my personal web diary, chronicling my recovery process following a hip replacement surgery. This project serves as a detailed log of my daily progress, challenges, exercises, and reflections from Day -1 (before surgery) through the crucial initial weeks and beyond.

About This Diary
This website is a single-page application (SPA) designed to provide an intuitive and interactive way to navigate through my recovery journey. You'll find:

Chronological Day-by-Day Entries: Read about my experiences, thoughts, and physical state for each day of my recovery.
Easy Navigation: Use "Previous Day" and "Next Day" buttons, or directly select a specific day to jump to any entry.
Multilingual Support: The entire diary content and user interface can be toggled between English and Spanish with a single click.
Exercise Progress Visualization: A dedicated section (accessible via the "Show Progress" button) features an interactive chart built with Chart.js to visualize daily exercise sets, total exercise minutes, and estimated calories burned, offering a clear overview of my physical rehabilitation.
Detailed Exercise Breakdown: For each day, see a breakdown of the exercises performed, with full descriptions for the initial days.
