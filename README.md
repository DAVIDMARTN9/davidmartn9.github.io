My Hip Replacement Recovery Diary
A Personal Journey Towards Healing and Strength

Welcome to my personal web diary, chronicling my recovery process following a hip replacement surgery. 
This project serves as a detailed log of my daily progress, challenges, exercises, and reflections from Day -1 (before surgery) through the crucial initial weeks and beyond.
